RichardBSpencer,"Why are so many civic nationalists and alt-lite members complaining about Sarah Jeong?

She’s an immigrant, she learned English, she got educated, she’s an employed taxpayer. She’s exactly the sort of person they advocate filling the country with!"

RichardBSpencer,"As I’ve stated before, I will *not* be participating in the Unite The Right 2 rally. (I’ll, of course, *consider* any good-faith offer for an appearance, as I did Kessler’s. But I’ve already made my decision clear on many occasions now.) https://twitter.com/pqpolitics/status/1026011019674439680 …"

RichardBSpencer,"I'm going to update ""Stop Watching Football"" and write a script for a video version. All for the start of Cuckball 2018!

Please reply with some points I missed or some links to new developments. https://www.radixjournal.com/2018/02/stop-watching-football/ …"
RichardBSpencer,"Sarah Jeong is a good argument against legal, skilled hi-IQ immigration from Asia.  Immigrants may come here just to work and be productive, but their kids get into the hate-whitey university system and end up indulging their little resentments and insecurities as race warfare."
RichardBSpencer,Brains this size shouldn't even be possible. https://twitter.com/petersweden7/status/1025527493250502656 …
RichardBSpencer,Boomers find a 4chan LARP of a senior intelligence official more believable than genetics influencing intelligence and personality
RichardBSpencer,"It's not just me who's getting deplatformed from venues. If you're making an impact, they try to shut you down. https://youtu.be/X0pOONm-nW8 "
RichardBSpencer,Who will instigate a global thermonuclear war with Russia over a territorial dispute in Ukraine or fund ISIS insurgents in Syria when Peepaw is gone? https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2018/08/02/meghan-mccain-glamour-interview-im-scared-america-without-dad-sen-john-mccain/889282002/ …

RichardBSpencer,Cursed tweet. https://twitter.com/Comey/status/1025445714128777216 …
RichardBSpencer,"Trump's supporters and detractors both desperately want to believe, for different reasons, that he's destroying the ""international order."" While this storyline is exciting in an ""end of history"" sort of way, it's also an illusion. My item: https://spectator.us/2018/08/admit-it-trump-basically-maintains-the-status-quo/ …"
RichardBSpencer,"'The West' betrayed imperial Russia in its war against the Turk. It's really unforgivable, and I am descended from the betrayer country.

Hopefully in the future we will never see such treason again."

RichardBSpencer,Is social media a human right? https://twitter.com/barstoolsports/status/1025192880061788160 …
RichardBSpencer,"The #Q people want comforting bromides and platitudes about how everything is going to be just fine, rather than being told that they will have to sacrifice something to earn their freedom. 

These are people that cannot handle cognitive dissonance."
RichardBSpencer,"This demonstrates the difficulty of what we are attempting. Moreover, it demonstrates that this is not a matter of “optics.” Antipathy towards White identity is embedded deep in the media-political power structure and also in the basic morality of average Americans."
RichardBSpencer,"You’re being rhetorical and sarcastic, but this is literally true. https://twitter.com/amfirstmedia/status/1025133432165130240 …"

RichardBSpencer,"So far 66% of people on Posobiec's poll of Trump supporters say that they believe in QANON.

As @JeffersonLeeTV says, this is an indicator of how easily people are manipulated. Remember that while you are waiting for them to ""wake up"".  https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1025137488975867905 …"
RichardBSpencer,"2. If somehow Fox News were forced to seriously engage with people like Spencer, Enoch, or Taylor, you'd see the network equivalent of the Chernobyl meltdown. Even CNN & MSNBC have done better jobs reporting about the Alt-Right than Fox."
RichardBSpencer,"Hey @DineshDSouza by your logic, is President Donald Trump a Democrat for honoring the legacy of Jackson? https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/842154802058543105 …"
RichardBSpencer,"last night Laura Ingraham said she had ""never heard of this Richard Spencer until 5 minutes ago. Literally never heard of him"". 

here's proof that she's totally full of shit.pic.twitter.com/BS918QP215"
RichardBSpencer,"Nice try, Laura Ingraham https://youtu.be/V_9ALf_Kjj4 "
RichardBSpencer,"It's doubtful that mainstream, FOX-level ""conservatives"" will embrace Q. But they won't denounce him either. The phenomenon serves their purposes, and they will put forth a slightly less wacky version of the Q narrative."
RichardBSpencer,"#Qanon is fascinating in that it a new type of conspiracy thinking. The Illuminati conspiracies were about these foreign elements (Jews, Catholics, Satanists, or literally aliens) controlling everything. Q tells his deluded adherents that *they* are part of the conspiracy!"
RichardBSpencer,"The problem with conspiracy thinking is not that it's entirely wrong: there *are* powerful cliques, which have far more influence than your elected representative. The problem with conspiracy thinking is that it inspires passivity. You could say that it is a slave morality."
RichardBSpencer,"As Trump became part of the system, his ""outsider,"" ""chaos candidate"" status was depleted. Enter ""Q,"" who put forth the provocative thesis that Trump was secretly about to arrest the Deep State and restore the Constitution."
RichardBSpencer,This is conservatism now..pic.twitter.com/yc006D2cD1
RichardBSpencer,"My sense is that Trump's people correctly perceived that Trump won in 2016 precisely because he was viewed as an outsider who would totally change the system, that he would be a big Fuck You to the Powers That Be. Basically, Trump was elected on the basis of deep White anxiety."
RichardBSpencer,"What is the overall message of Q to his Boomer adherents? 

Trust the plan . . . keep the faith . . . don't question or rethink anything . . . Trump and Mueller will take it from here . . . Vote for the GOP . . . 

Effectively, Q's message is *passivity*. Keep on keeping on."
RichardBSpencer,"My #QAnon conspiracy conspiracy—which I present as speculation—is that the author actually is a high-level person in the Trump admin or similar org, and he's engaging, quite successfully, in masterful propaganda. (Or I might be wrong and it's all done for the lulz by some troll.)"
RichardBSpencer,"I'm sad to announce that most everything #Qanon says, along with his bigger narrative, is complete gobbledygook. (I, of course, haven't read it all, but what I have looked at is laughable nonsense.)"
RichardBSpencer,"#QAnon has burst into the mainstream media today, so it's time that I reveal to the world my QAnon Conspiracy Conspiracy. 

Get ready to go down the deepest of all rabbit holes and take the reddest of red pills."
RichardBSpencer,Wow totally exposed! Spencer will never recover from saying nice things about Polk on camera

RichardBSpencer,"I don't have any easy answers, and I know the problems inherent to a third part in the American system. That said, I have been convinced that we need our own institutions, which can be immune to this process of wrong think => media and GOPe pushback => apology and resignation."
RichardBSpencer,"Until this process changes, Alt-Righters and nationalists working in the GOP are simply operating as labor for a party that has done nothing to prevent White dispossession—and, indeed, has done quite a bit to perpetuate it. It's not ""pragmatic""; it's the opposite of pragmatism."
RichardBSpencer,"The problem is, whenever someone articulates Alt-Right views of any kind—race realism, identitarian, even rational criticism of Israel—a predictable, Pavlovian process occurs. The media powers and high-level GOP attack the ""wrong think"" and he apologizes and resigns in disgrace."
RichardBSpencer,"The fact is, we already have tons of people in the GOP—including Cecily Wright, who resigned—who resonate with Trumpian nationalism. Most of the grassroots do. So on one level, ""entryism"" is redundant."
RichardBSpencer,"Funny how Conservatives think this is them outing @RichardBSpencer for what he truly is. Just listen/talk to Richard & he'll tell you himself that he disassociates from the Conservative movement, but that does not automatically make him a Liberal, hence the new term 'alt-right.' https://twitter.com/FiredFBIBoss/status/1025097837225406470 …"
RichardBSpencer,"James Allsup did nothing wrong, and I certainly have no moral objection to his entering politics on the local level. But this recent experience reveals the problems with ""entryism"" of the GOP.  @amfirstmedia"

RichardBSpencer,What a weight off my shoulders! I'm glad to hear that Jeong has learned her lesson and henceforward will express her racial antipathy against white Americans by making editorial decisions about the NYT's coverage rather than rhetorically inappropriate tweets.pic.twitter.com/4M1hzsOxT0

Oh wait, that’s already a social condition imposed on every citizen in the UK."
RichardBSpencer,"""They preferred not to know if it worked or not. Quite literally, they preferred not to know.""

That's Ron Hickel, the guy in charge of Canada's Mincome experiment in the 1970s, describing why it was shelved by conservatives and the data never analyzed.

RichardBSpencer,"Next time a conservative gives you the ""muh constitution"" argument show him this story.

A constitution is a social construct.
